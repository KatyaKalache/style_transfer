For this project I wanted to leverage the web & machine learning skills I learned to build something cool. Which is how this fun neural style transfer project came to be: www.style-transfer.tech (server is stopped at the moment, I can start it upon request)

I used a number of different open-source tools  ‚ù§Ô∏è   to build this website: Tensorflow, NumPy, Vgg19, OpenCV and Bootstrap.

## Project's flow
## 0. Upload and preprocess images
* rescale both content and style images to equal shape: image's pixels values are between 0 and 1 and its largest side is 512 pixels
* store as a numpy.ndarray
* set Tensorflow to execute eagerly
## 1. Load VGG19 Keras as base model
* my  model‚Äôs input is  the VGG19 input
* the model‚Äôs output a list containing the outputs of the VGG19 
## 2. Adding method that calculates gram matricies
* to capture style features from the style reference image and from the generated image
## 3. Extracting the features used to calculate neural style cost
## 4. Calculating the style, content and total costs for generated image
* Calculating the style cost for a single layer
![layer_style_cost](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_{l}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{C_{l}^{2}}\sum_{i}^{C_{l}}\sum_{j}^{C_{l}}(G^{l}_{ij}&space;-&space;A^{l}_{ij})^{2})
* Calculating the style cost for generated image
![total_style_cost](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L_{style}&space;=&space;\sum_{l}w_{l}E_{l})
* Calculating the content cost for the generated image
![total_content_cost](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L_{content}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{H_{l}W_{l}C_{l}}\sum_{i}^{H_{l}}\sum_{j}^{W_{l}}\sum_{k}^{C_{l}}(F_{ijk}^{l}-P_{ijk}^{l})^2)
## 5. Computing the gradients for the generated image

## 6. Generating  the neural style transfered image
* gradient descent is performed using Adam optimization
* keeping track of the best cost and the image associated with that cost
